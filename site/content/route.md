2019 is the year of the bike tour for us. Justin has semi-retired from work to allow us to travel the world for a year or 2, or really however long we want to tour the world. 

The plan for this first year is to follow in the footsteps of many of the wonderful [Warmshowers](https://warmshowers.org) guests that we have had stay with us in Zhuhai, China over the past 4 years. 

We will fly to Bangkok sometime in the beginning of March and begin the long-haul bike tour towards Portugal or Spain. 

Will we make it all the way? Who knows, and who cares. 

> It's about the journey, not the destination. 

We plan to ride 50+ miles per day approximately 6 days per week which will total 300 miles per week. Over the course of 9 months that could total 11,700 miles. 

But will we make that distance every day? Maybe. Maybe not. 

In the end, we are on a journey to explore the world, to try new foods, and to enjoy ourselves after a long 4 years in China. 

## The Route

Starting from Bangkok, the route is more or less determined by the locations that we want to see and the countries that we can and cannot go to. 

The first stop after Bangkok is Chiang Mai, Thailand, before we traverse Laos into Vietnam. We are going to Vietnam so we can see [Detian Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Gioc%E2%80%93Detian_Falls) before heading into China. 

China is a huge country and we will be running the Western side while staying out of Tibet. There are lots of cool places to see, and I think Chishui in Guizhou is on the list along with returning to Chengdu. After running through Sichuan province we will likely hit Qinghai lake and Gansu province before traversing the long desert area of Xinjiang. 

Coming out of Xinjiang, we will be leaving China and heading into Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. We have lots of feedback to stay out of the "Stans", but it really is the only way through central Asia. Kyrgyzstan will be absolutely beautiful as we ride through the Tien-Shan mountains. 

Once through Kyrgyzstan and into Uzbekistan it really is just a run through the desert until we can get to Aktau in Kazakhstan where we will take the ferry across the Caspian Sea to Baku in Azerbaijan. 

From there, we are on our way into Eastern Europe and then through central and Western Europe. We plan to hug the Mediterranean Sea as we go through Europe. There is so much to see in Europe and we could certainly spend more time there exploring, but it will mostly be dependent on time. 

After 4 years of missing all of our family on the holidays, we WILL be home for Thanksgiving and Christmas. So after ~9 months of traveling we will come home for the holidays to rest, relax and visit with family as we prepare for part 2 of our adventure. 

Do we know where part 2 will take us? 

Not yet, but the ideas will come along the journey.
