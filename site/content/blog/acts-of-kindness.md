When you are riding along on a bike tour and you break down on the side of the road your day comes to an abrupt halt. This is when you start pondering why your bike decided to break down. Sometimes you get super angry at the bike and others you are just plain disappointed that your bike decided to not cooperate. 

Needless to say, we are almost always not in a good mood when our gear decides to break. 

However, this is the time when I have received the greatest acts of kindness from others on our trip. From help fixing a flat to meals and places to stay and everything in between we have been the fortunate beneficiaries of acts of kindness from others. 

## Why do people help out total strangers?

Maybe it is for the good feeling it gives them. In the Buddhist tradition, those that give the most receive the most. In other words in order to live the most fulfilling and rich life you must give to others unconditionally. 

The Buddhist way of life is truly inspiring. We see each and every day instances of the kindness that they give each other. When we rise at 5AM to beat the heat, we get to see the tradition of alms giving in the morning. This is when the monks come around from home to home begging or asking for food to eat. The tradition is seen as good for both sides. The people of the town are able to help the monks survive and live with nearly nothing by giving freely, expecting nothing in return. For the monks, on the other hand, this is a humbling experience, an exercise in humility. 

We rarely see the younger generation out for alms giving, only the older grandmas on the side of the street with their bamboo steamers full of sticky rice, but it give hope to all to see that acts of kindness are still free flowing in society.

## Our acts of kindness

We have opened up our home in China and in the US to touring cyclists on [Warmshowers](https://www.warmshowers.org) so that they can have a place to rest. 

Why do we do it? 

We enjoy listening to the stories of those that are travelling. It may actually have persuaded us to head out on this very adventure. Riding across Asia and into Europe was not something we pondered on until we heard of others doing it ahead of us that we hosted. 

We also just enjoy the company of new people that are interesting and similar in spirit to us. To get to know and become friends with total strangers is a wonderful experience. Is it selfish to host someone so that you can become friends?

## Acts of kindness that we have received

There have multiple times in the first month of traveling where we have received great acts of kindness that have then gone on to refuse payment. We would happily pay, but they had no desire and refused payment. I suppose seeing payment as a sign that they would not have helped if they were not getting paid. Better to give freely. 

### The First Act

The first act was when we had another flat tire. This was flat number 5 of the trip and I was pretty tired of fixing them. It just so happened that at the time the team manager of the Provincial Cycling Team of Singburi was riding by on his scotter. He stopped and helped us fix the flat, but first he had to ride his scooter home and pick up his truck with parts. 

When he returned, he had all the parts and pieces to fix the flat tire, first filling the tube with tube sealant that fixes holes as they appear, and then patching the tube before mounting it back all without my help. Afterwards, he gave us his bottle of sealant, which seemed like a great idea at the time (we eventually gave it away since it didn't work for the types of punctures we were getting). 

He then had us follow him to his house where he fed us breakfast that he had. He left us with his son, a politician in the local government and a member of the Thai National Cycling team while he ran into town and bought us new tubes and stick meat and sticy rice for the road. For all of this, he refused payment. The only payment he got from us was a picture with us in front of his Singburi cycling team sign. 

Within 5 minutes of leaving his house we had a driver pull over in front of us. Usually this is a bad sign, as someone is about to spout out a bunch of curse words about cyclists on the road and what not, but he held out a bottle of cold water that we gratefully took and were on our way again. So you never know when people are out to help.

### The Second Act

Still on the same day as the first act, we had another flat tire. This one we fixed ourselves no problem, but when it came time to put the wheel back on, the nut for the axle was stripped and I was not able to fasten the rear wheel on. 

I flagged down a lady on a scooter that was passing by at the time and sent her off in search of a nut. Much to our dismay and confusion, she was not able to find a nut at the first place, nor at the second, third or fourth try. We went with another group of people across the street to try and find a nut. I pulled one off of an old bike that was laying in their garage, but it didn't fit either. 

Who knew that the Sram Dual Drive hub had special sized nuts? 

Eventually, they gave up looking for a nut and we walked / pushed the bike with her help over to her friend's farm equipment shop to find a nut. We still were not able to find a nut, but he managed to crank one on that was the wrong size and send us off to Chai Nat the next town up the road where we could find a bike shop. 

After spending more than 2 hours with these guys they also refused payment and sent us on our way.

### The Third Act

This is still the same day. Once arriving to Chai Nat, we were fortunate enough to find that there was a cycling event being held in town that day that was just finishing up. We found a very nice Swiss cyclist and asked him for help with finding someone that could get our wheel up and running for us. He directed us down the road to what looked like an abandoned warehouse and explained to the crazy looking man inside that we needed a nut to fit onto our wheel. 

You never would have known from looking at it from the outside, but he had dropped us off at a full-blown machine shop. The guy that helped us came out with calipers and thread gauges and measured the axle and then made a nice new nut out of carbon steel to fit onto our axle. It turned out that he measured the axle at 10mm with a 1.0mm thread. 

After tapping a new nut for us, it still not fit. He came out and measured again and tapped again. This cycle went on 3 or 4 times before we decided that the axle was actually slightly larger than a standard 10mm bolt. I figured it was an SAE sized bolt since it was from the US, but later I found out that is also not true. 

We ended up inside his machine shop putting the wheel on his metal lathe and using the threading attachment to cut down the size of the axle where the new nut would ride to 10mm. It really was crazy to see this in action and only slightly scary as your rear wheel really is your most important part as it bears the most weight while you are riding. 

Once done, he was able to get the new nut onto our axle with no problems. He worked on our wheel for at least 1.5 hours on a Sunday and refused payment again. 

All of this on the same day, but to the Thai people to give freely in the only way. It seems they may never make money if they only give, but that may actually work out. 

After 7 hours of riding/waiting that day for a measly 60 km we were done and stayed in Chai Nat for the night.

## Acts of kindness are all around

People all around the world are innately nice and willing to help out when you have issues. The three acts I detailed above were all from one day, but we have received help many more times from wonderful and kind people. 

We can all learn a thing or 2 from those that give freely. To give freely you will live a better more fulfilling life. We will certainly make sure to pay it forward in the future.
